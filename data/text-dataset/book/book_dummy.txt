Chapter 1   Â    "No problem, Mrs. S." Josie propped her cell phone between her shoulder and left ear, pouring hot water onto her oatmeal.
"I've already okayed it with the folks, and should be able to stay the full two weeks starting Saturday.
I can't wait to see the kids!"
Josie smiled as the call ended, settling the kettle back on the stove, and grabbing a spoon from the kitchen drawer.
She placed her phone and bowl onto the table and plopped down into a chair to eat her oatmeal.
"Breakfast of champions."
She laughed.
She'd need the strength in the days to come.
Everything was set, the i's firmly dotted and t's crossed.
She'd start on her overflowing laundry basket tonight, pack her bag and what not tomorrow, and be ready-to-go on Saturday.
